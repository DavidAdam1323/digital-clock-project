# Digital Clock Project

Welcome to my Digital Clock project! This project focuses on creating a straightforward digital clock using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It's designed to provide hands-on experience with essential front-end web technologies.

### Overview

This project features a digital clock that accurately displays the current time, including hours, minutes, and seconds. The clock updates every second to ensure precision. It's a practical project for JavaScript learners to enhance their skills in DOM manipulation, CSS styling, and real-time functionality implementation.

### Project Goals

As a JavaScript student, this project serves several educational purposes:

- **DOM Manipulation:** Practice manipulating the Document Object Model to dynamically update content.
- **CSS Styling:** Gain familiarity with CSS for creating visually appealing and responsive designs.
- **Real-Time Functionality:** Implement real-time updates using JavaScript to reflect current time accurately.

### Implementation

Here's a breakdown of the project components:

- **HTML:** Defines the structure of the clock in index.html.
- **CSS:** Styles the clock for a clean and responsive layout in styles.css.
- **JavaScript:** Powers the clock's functionality, updating time every second in scripts.js.
