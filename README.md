# digital-clock-project
This project involves creating a digital clock using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The clock displays the current time with hours, minutes, and seconds, updating every second for accuracy. This project is an excellent way to practice and enhance my skills in manipulating the DOM, using CSS for styling, and implementing real-time functionality.
